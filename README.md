# Louis' Blog

Hi I'm Louis Boucquet and I have a mind that never stops coming up with odd, quircky and whacky ideas.
As these ideas stack up I need a place to dump them, a sort of void to shout in if you will.

Concepts I think about range from technical programming stuff to philosophical and psychological stuff.
The idea is to dump ideas in here without giving it too much time, that means I will do very little research.
I'm kind of like an arm-chair-philosopher/scientist.
Take this this blog for what it is, ... gossip.

Without further ado, enjoy my stream of consciousness.
