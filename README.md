# Louis' Blog

Hi I'm Louis Boucquet and I have a mind that never stops coming up with odd, quircky and whacky ideas.
As these ideas stack up I need a place to dump these ideas or they'll jump around in my head forever.
A sort of void to scream in if you will.
So if you're interested in my screams into the void, this is the blog.
Strap in, you're in for a rough ride.

Concepts I talk about range from technical programming stuff to philosophical and psychological stuff.
The whole idea is to dump ideas in here without giving it to much thought so that means I will do very little research.
I'm kind of like an arm-chair-philosopher/scientist.
Take this this blog for what it is, ... gossip.

Without further ado, enjoy my stream of consciousness.
