# Elegance in simplicity

Why is it often said that elegance and simplicity go hand in hand?
The idea "Do more with less"

I'm thinking about a scene in Indiana Jones, where Indiana encounters a legendary sword fighter who shows off his skill by doing a mind bogglingly spectacular dance with his two swords swinging in every direction to which Indiana responds by shrugging his shoulders and just shooting down the sword fighter.

Is bluntly shooting someone point blank elegant?
Perhaps not, but I'm pretty sure Indiana came out on top of that exchange.

Talking this concept to music, you might have a guitarist that can play a thousand notes in a second, and sure, he'll turn heads for a while, but I'll always look for the guitar player who plays the three notes in the exact perfect timing and articulation that just hits me in the stomach.

The same goes for IT, Mathematics, Physics and any field in which think up theories.
When you have a theory/formula/codebase that works you should not strive for complexity but simplicity.
If the same concepts can be described with less tokens, your description is more general and more related to the core truth of what you're describing.

[//]: # (Insert a good example)

[//]: # (You might observe that "if A then B" and extract a theory out of that observation.)
[//]: # (But just as Indiana Jones and the guitar player, you should always look for the most fundamental reason for things.)

In the same way, when explaining things, I always try to use a little words as possible.
This removes unnecessary clutter and makes it easier to grasp the core of what you're trying to convey.

This, for me, is elegant.
