# The rhythm of conversation

Have you ever had an awkward silence?
Or had a very busy conversation where you found it difficult to jump in?

Conversation can be hard enough face to face, a conversation in a group can be overwhelming.
This effect gets amplified even more when you add people in the conversation who are remote.

In this blog post I explore observations about conversation and share some theories bound with concrete metrics.
I put these though under the umbrella title "the rhythm of conversation" because, as you'll see, conversation is very much time bound.
You cannot understand all the subtleties of a conversation without knowing the spacing of sentences, words and, most importantly, responses.

## The space between

A conversation usually gets interesting when someone's sentence has finished.
Most sentences that starts also finish
Unless you stumble over your words or you talk very slowly because you're still thinking hard about what you're saying or something else interrupts you.
But in general, a sentence that starts will finish.
That means that during a sentence there's little interaction with your conversation partners.
A look here and there or an "uhu" or some other none verbal language.
Once the sentence is finish though anything can happen.

In a slow conversation there might be a pause.
That pause might be long and awkward, or it could signify that nothing has to be said, you could both sit back satisfied and content.
Or perhaps one of the conversation participants is thinking and receiving the time to do it.
Or ...

In a quicker conversation, definitely in group, there might barely be a pause.
Someone might be so excited to share their opinion that they don't even wait for the pause to start talking.

Conversations have 2 big factors influencing this silence: speed and excitement

### Speed

A conversation has an inherent speed to it.
You can observe this by the at which words get said or the amount of time between sentences.

### Excitement

In any conversation participants will have a level of engagement in a conversation.
You might be bored out of your mind having nothing to say or you could be on the edge of your seat, ready to spout of whatever thoughts just came to your mind.

### Complexity

In a complex conversation you'll often need some time to think

## TTA - *T*ime '*T*ill *A*wkward

Part of the reason I call this "TTA" is because everything sounds more legit when you give it an acronym.
As if it gets use that often that it awards the use of a short hand.
In this case I'd be surprised if anyone else has even named anything "time 'till awkward".

TTA is the time it takes for a silence to get awkward.
This is very personal and heavily depends on how comfortable a person feels in any given conversation.
In some conversations there might not even come a time were it gets awkward.

Often time, when a person starts feeling awkward, people will start to think about stuff to say with which they can fill the silence.
Often filler words like "en azo nje", or they will default to some basic learned conversation bits like "have you planned anything this weekend?" or "everything still fine at work?".

This sort of silence usually comes in a conversation where there's not much left to say.

### TTA enforced by social anxiety

An awkward silence can be noticed most often when people have ran out of conversation elements and find that hard to admit.
Sometimes an awkward silence can also come when there's a clear conversation element to speak of but for whatever social reason it's difficult to say.
For example when a public speaker asks "any more questions", it might be scary to ask your question.
When other people start to ask their questions that social anxiety drops away because asking questions gets normalized.
In that case its normal and ok to ask your question and that awkward silence can be resolved.

## Uuhm

Uuhm is not meaningless, it communicates that there's more to come.

For example when you get asked a difficult question and you want to acknowledge that you've properly received the question and are thinking of an answer you might just simply say "uuhm".
Notice that, while also acting as an acknowledgement, it also claims space in a conversation.
When someone asks a question in a slow conversation you don't necessarily need to say "uuhm", sometimes you will just receive the space to think without having to claim it.

## Flow

There's a sort of self reinforcing feedback loop that causes people who are talking a lot to keep talking a lot.
This is most of all noticeable in group, but can also be noticed in a direct conversation.
Sometime it can be hard to shut someone up.

How "likely" or "normal" it is for someone to talk depends a lot on how much of the last few sentences they've said.
That also makes it difficult to come out of a long silence, cause you're breaking your pattern.
Of course it also depends on other factors, some people naturally jump in quicker, or an authoritative figure will be able to jump in to a conversation from silence more easily.

### Reflection

Some people carefully think about what they're gonna say so that they need just a little more time to form an idea or sentence that they can share.
It can be hard for people like that to jump in to a busy conversation because by the time they've though out their idea someone else will have jumped in.
When you're asked a question directly you can claim your space by using the uuhm trick but saying uuhm unprompted doesn't really work the same.
