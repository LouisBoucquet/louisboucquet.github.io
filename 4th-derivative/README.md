# 4th derivative

Most of us have experienced that little bump when coming to a stop in a car.
Have you ever wondered why it's so hard to stop smoothly.
In this blog post I will explain the physics behind a stopping car and what you need to do to come to a smooth stop.
It will also explain why it's so difficult.

## The physics of moving

Before understanding in depth how we experience that physics of moving you first need to understand the physics itself.
Starting with the most basic thing

### Newton's formula

At the fundament of the physics of car movements lays Newton's most famous formula:

```
F = m * a
```

Where `F` is the force acting on a car, exerted by a car's engine and brakes.
The `m` is the mass, or in lame men's terms "the weight of a car".
Lastly, the `a` is acceleration, is the trickiest concept to explain, but put simply it's how quickly a car is changing speed.

What this formula means is that a car accelerates more slowly when it weighs more.
It accelerates more quickly when you give more gas and decelerates quicker when you apply more braking force.

The way we understand this formula as humans is usually to see what effect the force (`F`) and the mass (`m`) have on the acceleration (`c`).
That is to say that we want to control these factors to indirectly impact the acceleration.
For example, a powerful car with a heavy strong engine will have more acceleration.
On the other hand a lighter car with a tinier engine might have the same acceleration.
This is a concept many people know intuitively.

### Acceleration

We keep talking about acceleration which I vaguely defined as "how quickly something changes speed".
A more formal definition of the acceleration is "the derivative of speed".
Where a derivative signifies "how quickly something changes", but then defined in a mathematically strict way.

The speed, also called velocity, in turn is the derivative of something's location.
Again "derivative" signifies how quickly something changes in terms of an other factor.
In this case speed measures how quickly the location of an object changes.
An object moving at high speed changes location more quickly than an object moving with low speed.
It does seem simple when explain in normal language doesn't it?

In short:

* speed is the 1st derivative of an object's location
* acceleration is it's second derivative

## The way we experience these physics

Now that we know the basic physics of movement we can understand what it is exactly that we feel when a car comes to a stand still.

In general we as humans mainly see changes instead of observing exact values.
Thing of entering a bright room after having in in a dark one.
We usually register that we have entered a bright room although we don't know exactly how bright.
The only thing we know is that, based on our previous context, this room is a lot brighter that the previous one.
Once we get used to this new room this one will seem normal while the previous room will seem dark.

In that same way, when sitting in a car, we notice the force applied to us, but not as an exact measurement.
When having a specific force applied to us it normalizes.
We only really notice when the force applied changes, for example when the driver suddenly slams the brakes or stomps on the acceleration pedal.
Of course this has its limits, extreme enough forces will register anyway because they're more difficult to get used to.
But within reason we only feel the changes in force.
Another way to say this is that "we feel the change in acceleration", or rather "we feel the derivative of acceleration".

But wait a minute wasn't acceleration the second derivative of an object's location?
So in essence we mainly feel the 3rd derivative of a car's location.

Knowing this opens up the key to coming to a smooth stop, we need to minimize the 3rd derivative of our car's location.

## Conclusion

Now knowing theoretically that we need to minimize the 3rd derivative of location we can extract that we need to increase or decrease breaking or accelerating slowly.
We can break hard or accelerated hard but just not suddenly, at least when you don't want you passenger to barf that is.

When stopping a car you apply a certain break force right until the point you stand completely still.
That means that in that point of standstill your breaking force suddenly changes to 0, because you're suddenly standing still and can't break anymore.
This is the exact thing we should minimize to brake as smoothly as possible.
So what you want to do to minimize the change in braking force is to ease of your break when you're near a stand still.
This will ensure that the jump from breaking force to no force is as small as possible.
Ideally you'll have released your break completely in the moment you're standing still.
That would mean that the change in breaking power would have ben smooth the whole wat through.
