# 3th Derivative

Most of us have experienced that little bump when coming to a stop in a car.
Have you ever wondered why it's so hard to stop smoothly?
In this blog post, I will explain the physics behind a stopping car and what you need to do to come to a smooth stop.
It will also explain why it's so difficult.

## The Physics of Moving

Before understanding in depth how we experience the physics of moving, you first need to understand the physics itself.
Let's start with the basics.

### Newton's Formula

At the foundation of the physics of car movements lies Newton's most famous formula:

```
F = m * a
```

Where `F` is the force acting on a car, exerted by a car's engine and brakes.
The `m` is the mass, or in layman's terms, "the weight of a car".
Lastly, the `a` is acceleration, which is the trickiest concept to explain, but put simply, it's how quickly a car is changing speed.

What this formula means is that a car accelerates more slowly when it weighs more.
It accelerates more quickly when you give it more gas and decelerates quicker when you apply more braking force.

The way we understand this formula as humans is usually to see what effect the force (`F`) and the mass (`m`) have on the acceleration (`a`).
That is to say, we want to control these factors to indirectly impact the acceleration.
For example, a powerful car with a heavy, strong engine will have more acceleration.
On the other hand, a lighter car with a smaller engine might have the same acceleration.
This is a concept many people know intuitively.

### Acceleration

We keep talking about acceleration, which I vaguely defined as "how quickly something changes speed".
A more formal definition of acceleration is "the derivative of speed", where a derivative signifies "how quickly something changes", but then defined in a mathematically strict way.

Speed, also called velocity, in turn, is the derivative of an object's location.
Again, "derivative" signifies how quickly something changes in terms of another factor.
In this case, speed measures how quickly the location of an object changes.
An object moving at high speed changes location more quickly than an object moving at low speed.
It does seem simple when explained in normal language, doesn't it?

In short:

* Speed is the 1st derivative of an object's location.
* Acceleration is its 2nd derivative.

## The Way We Experience Physics

Now that we know the basic physics of movement, we can understand what it is exactly that we feel when a car comes to a standstill.

In general, we as humans mainly perceive changes instead of observing exact values.
Think of entering a bright room after being in a dark one.
We usually register that we have entered a bright room although we don't know exactly how bright.
The only thing we know is that, based on our previous context, this room is a lot brighter than the previous one.
Once we get used to this new room, this one will seem normal while the previous room will seem dark.

In the same way, when sitting in a car, we notice the force applied to us, but not as an exact measurement.
When having a specific force applied to us, it normalizes.
We only really notice when the force applied changes, for example, when the driver suddenly slams the brakes or stomps on the acceleration pedal.
Of course, this has its limits; extreme enough forces will register anyway because they're more difficult to get used to.
But within reason, we only feel the changes in force.
Another way to say this is that "we feel the change in acceleration", or rather "we feel the derivative of acceleration".

But wait a minute, wasn't acceleration the second derivative of an object's location?
So in essence, we mainly feel the 3rd derivative of a car's location.

Knowing this opens up the key to coming to a smooth stop: we need to minimize the 3rd derivative of our car's location.

## Conclusion

Now knowing theoretically that we need to minimize the 3rd derivative of location, we can deduce that we need to increase or decrease braking or accelerating slowly.
We can brake hard or accelerate hard, but just not suddenly, at least if you don't want your passengers to barf, that is.

When stopping a car, you apply a certain brake force right until the point you come to a complete stop.
That means that at the moment of standstill, your braking force suddenly changes to 0 because you're suddenly standing still and can't brake anymore.
This is exactly what we should minimize to brake as smoothly as possible.
So what you want to do to minimize the change in braking force is to ease off your brake when you're near a standstill.
This will ensure that the jump from braking force to no force is as small as possible.
Ideally, you'll have released your brake completely at the moment you're standing still.
That would mean that the change in braking power would have been smooth the whole way through.
