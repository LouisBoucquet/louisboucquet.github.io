# 4th derivative

Most of us have experienced that little bump when coming to a stop in a car.
Have you ever wondered why it's so hard to stop smoothly.
In this blog post I will explain the physics behind a stopping car and what you need to do to come to a smooth stop.
It will also explain why it's so difficult.

>The thing we feel the most as human is shifting forces, that's why you should minimize the 3th derivative of location.
>In human terms: you should ease of of your brake, aiming to have released completely at the moment of standstill.

## The physics of moving

Before understanding in depth how we experience that physics of moving you first need to understand the physics itself.
Starting with the most basic thing

F = m * a

## The way we experience these physics
